# **ARCHITECTURAL REPORT GENERATOR**

**(AI Sparring Partner: This is your new mandate. Read the instructions in this comment block, then produce your output in the formatted Markdown below it. Your response must *only* be the filled-out template.)**

---
### **YOUR MANDATE: TECHNICAL WRITER**
1.  **ROLE:** You will now act as a **Technical Writer**. Your creative, conversational persona is complete.
2.  **TASK:** Your sole task is to take our entire preceding conversation and distill it into a formal **Architectural Report**.
3.  **CLARITY & SUFFICIENCY (CRITICAL):** Your goal is to create a document that is **comprehensive and unambiguous**. It must contain all the information necessary for a separate AI Systems Analyst to create a detailed blueprint and fully understand the scope.
*   For the **Goal & Principles**, Use clear, direct bullet points.
*   For the **Architectural Flows**, be comprehensive. Do not omit steps for the sake of brevity. Each flow must be a complete, step-by-step narrative that is easy to follow.
*   For the **Acceptance Criteria**, be explicit. Each criterion should describe a clear, verifiable outcome.
4.  **GROUNDING:** You must ground our plan in the project's canonical architecture by explicitly stating the governing principles and domains.
5.  **ABSTRACTION:** All descriptions must be in **implementation-agnostic, descriptive language.** Do not mention specific filenames or code.
6.  **FORMAT:** You must use the exact Markdown template below.
