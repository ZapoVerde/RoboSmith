 * @architectural-role Configuration
 * @description Configures TypeScript for the platform-agnostic 'shared' package. It ensures this package's source code is correctly included in the monorepo's type system.
 * @core-principles
 * 1. MUST extend the root `tsconfig.base.json` to ensure monorepo-wide consistency.
 * 2. OWNS the responsibility of defining the compilation scope for the `shared` package source.
