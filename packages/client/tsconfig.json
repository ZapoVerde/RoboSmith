 * @description Configures TypeScript for the VS Code extension's backend ('client') package. It enables the monorepo's path aliases and defines the files included in this part of the project.
 * @core-principles
 * 1. MUST extend the root `tsconfig.base.json` to ensure monorepo-wide consistency.
 * 2. OWNS the responsibility of defining the compilation scope for the `client` package source.
